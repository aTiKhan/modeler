--------------------------------------------

Build server will need npm package dropdown in addition to composer
Add a check to make sure semver was incremented correctly when merged into main branch

Tasks for js team
- make it work with HMR in core or at least npm run watch
- must compile in less than 3 seconds when change detected
- Maybe we should still package this as a composer package so we can do art packages:develop modeler

---------------------------------------------

art packages:develop modeler --- assumes processmaker/package-modeler
- Anything with the prefix processmaker/package-* is assumed to have the following SLA contract:
-- npm run watch must publish --force on core

Command asks:
- where to save locally (default ../packages/ProcessMaker/package-{name})
- Checks if exists, clones if not
- Adds to composer repository SOMEHOW NOT EDITING COMPOSER.JSON?????? like a global setting???
  - see in vagrant: ~/.composer/config.json
  - somebody already attempted to do this with a wildcard!
- Runs composer install, gives instructions to npm run watch on package


---------------- FRIDAY QUESTIONS --------------------

- Continue as composer package for above reasons?
- Carve out time for packages:develop (rework package command in general)
